I would love to be a part of this project because I think that it could be really helpful to students to find appropriately priced housing and not get scalped.I would love to contribute by helping to model the database and plan the system. I would also be interested in helping to build out a UI to go with the system if needed. I think that it could be an interesting project technically because of the complexity of the database. I think that it could be interesting as a businedd market because I feel like people don't have a solid grasp on prices, especially since so many housing opportunities are not listed online. I think that there may be problems with PII, but that that could be regulated by dividing the information into seperate tables.
