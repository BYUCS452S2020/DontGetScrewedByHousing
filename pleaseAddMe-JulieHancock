Why me: (why interested & how i'd contribute)
- Housing (especially in provo) is the worst. I have an absolute hatred for Aspen Ridge, so a product like this would help a lot of people save a lot of $$ and frustration. 
- I'm good at programming (interned as an Android Dev @ Ancestry.com last summer and in like a month)
- I have a decent knowledge of SQLite (240 TA for 3 semesters)
- Also learned a decent amount of backend (especially hooking up to front end) @ Ancestry
- Love & meet the requirements (except I might fight you on the last bullet)
- I agree - lets really put the MINIMAL in MVP. 10/10 line in your proposal.
- I'm far in the program (graduate in December)

Business:
- Sounds perfect. I hate paying for things and I love coding, so this sounds great.

Legal:
- seems legit. won't ask any other questions...

Technical:
- I'm real good at frontend (Java/Kotlin) and can pretty easily make a simple UI and help hook it up to the backend (depending on the backend language)
- I don't see the tables as super difficult to define, so that's chill.
- I also love backend stuff, so I'm here for it all
- Good at picking up new languages, so 10/10 lets do it.
