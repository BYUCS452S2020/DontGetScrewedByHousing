Reasons Interested:

Seems like a legimate project that might be useful to people outside this class. 
Attitudes about the project align--especially minimalism.
I'd like to get this out of the way as soon as possible (Graduating In June).

Areas Of Contribution:

Anything. Work on front-end, back-end, gathering contract data, etc. Can learn anything needed.

Business:

Could be a useful tool to spread around the Provo area. Also, seems scalable assuming we could get contract data from other sources.

Techincal:

Great plan. Easily broken up into understandable portions.

Legal:

Sounds about right.
