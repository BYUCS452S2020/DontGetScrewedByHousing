I love this idea.  Housing is such a pain and I think that this would legitimantly help everyone (including me).  I recently just tried to find married housing and it was the worst.  I had no idea what was a good price for what I was looking for, and it would be nice to get some numbers on that.  I also think that an idea like this could change the housing game in Provo, and drive unreasonable prices lower, which would be a huge plus for everyone!  I have good SQL Lite experience and moderate MongoDB knowledge, also a plus is that I can learn fast.  I am also good at planning and thinking of extranalities, so we can cover everything the database needs!  One thing that I think would be helpful, is providing some basic numbers and data on the results, like a precentile number on how the aspects you care about might compare in the market, or something that is similar to Zillow that gives an estimate on what your monthly rent should be based on the market in that neighborhood.

Bussiness: I agree that this service should be free and have ads like basically every other service website.

Legal:  Something that might help, is when people enter their information to compare, they can opt to submit their data to the database if they want to, and if the database doesn't have that information, or it has been updated or changed since the last submission, it can update the database.  This way we can have relevant information.

Technical:  I like the stages.  With my precentile idea, that can be an option of how we can compare contracts.
